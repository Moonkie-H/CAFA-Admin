/**
 * The vocabulary a connector describes its answer in.
 *
 * This is JSON Schema, narrowed to the handful of keywords the content actually
 * uses, and it exists so that api.json is *compiled* rather than written by
 * hand. A hand-written OpenAPI file is a second copy of the truth that drifts
 * the first time a field is renamed; these builders let a connector declare its
 * shape beside its reader, in the same object, so the two cannot disagree
 * without a TypeScript error.
 *
 * The component schemas below mirror shared/content/types.ts as the *published*
 * bundle carries it — which is not quite the editable content set, and the
 * differences are deliberate. worker/domain/bundle.ts adds `url`, `locales`
 * and `localeNames` to `site`, lifts `localeName` out of each dictionary, and
 * empties a private work's cover and media. What is written here is what a
 * client will actually receive.
