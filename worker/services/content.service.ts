/**
 * Reading and saving the draft.
 *
 * Saving writes the live tables. That *is* the draft — it is what the preview
 * build reads, and it is what a publish later snapshots. So the only two things
 * a save does beyond the write are the parts that make it safe and visible:
 * validate first, poke the preview after.
 *
 * The validation is the same `checkContent` the editor's form runs. Running it
 * again here is not belt-and-braces — it is the only copy that cannot be
 * skipped by a client that has been edited, replaced or scripted.
