/**
 * What the public site is built from.
 *
 * A published revision is not the editable content set — it is a projection of
 * it, and the difference is load-bearing in two ways.
 *
 * First, **a private work publishes nothing but its row in the index.** The
 * site lists private works and gives them no page; the guarantee that their
 * photographs never reach a browser lives here, where the data leaves the
 * database, rather than in the frontend that draws them.
 *
 * Second, **the parts of `site` that are not editable are added here.** The
 * locales and their names are wired to the template's lib/routes.ts and to the
 * deployment, so they are code rather than content — but what a language calls
 * itself in the switch is a word on a screen, so it lives in the copy table as
 * `localeName` and is lifted out into `site` here.
 *
 * The nav used to be here too, as a hardcoded array of four items whose labels
 * were looked up from `nav.*` copy keys. It is gone, and that is the point of
 * this change: the bar is a projection of the pages now, derived by the
 * template from each page's `navLabel`, so nothing in this repository decides
 * which pages the site has or which of them the bar carries. Adding a page adds
 * a URL and, if it has a label, an item — with no deploy on either side.
 *
 * `url` is the same kind of thing as the locales, and arrives the same way. It
 * is the origin the site is deployed on — every canonical, hreflang, og:url and
 * sitemap entry in the template is resolved against it — so it belongs to the
 * deployment, not to the content. It comes from PRODUCTION_URL, which is the
 * same value the admin already polls for build-info.json: one origin, named
 * once. Migration 0002 dropped the column it used to have.
