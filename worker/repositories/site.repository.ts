/**
 * The site row.
 *
 * One row, by construction — `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1)`. That
 * constraint is the seam that makes multi-tenant a migration rather than a
 * rewrite, and it costs one table to leave open.
 *
 * `locales` and `url` are not here. They are wired to the template's
 * lib/routes.ts and to the deployment, and are added when a revision is built.
 * Nor are the studio photographs: they are a `gallery` section on the front
 * page now (migration 0005), which is the same photographs with one owner
 * instead of two.
