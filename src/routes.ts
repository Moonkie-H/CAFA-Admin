/**
 * The admin's own routes, and the whole of its router.
 *
 * Path-based rather than hash-based, because the infrastructure for it is
 * already paid for: `not_found_handling: "single-page-application"` in
 * wrangler.jsonc means the Worker hands unknown paths to index.html, and the
 * Worker checks /api and /auth before it gets there — so /works reaches this
 * file and nothing collides.
 *
 * Nine routes and no parameters do not justify a routing library. What they do
 * justify is a route *table*: one array that navigation renders from, that the
 * shell dispatches on, and that keeps content and utility destinations in one
 * typed place. The previous shape had the labels in one const and the
 * rendering in a chain of `section === 'works' &&` further down the same file,
 * which is two lists to keep in step.
 *
 * The order is the order of the sidebar, and it is meant: the control panel is
 * where you land and where the state of the site is answered, the six editing
 * sections are the work — pages first, since a page is what the rest appears
 * on — and the last two are for looking backwards, at what has been published
 * and at what the site's own frontend can read. `group` is the heading each run
 * of them sits under, so the sidebar is this table read top to bottom and
 * nothing is reachable only through a menu.
