/**
 * The shape of the content the studio owns.
 *
 * This mirrors CAFA-Template's `src/lib/types.ts`, and deliberately diverges
 * from it in two places — both of which are the same idea, that the admin's
 * types should describe what the admin can actually change:
 *
 *  - **`SiteContent` has no `locales` or `localeNames`.** Those are wired to the
 *    template's lib/routes.ts and to the deployment. worker/domain/bundle.ts
 *    adds them when it builds a published revision, so the template still
 *    receives the complete record it expects.
 *  - **`Dictionary` has `localeName`, which the template's does not.** What a
 *    language calls itself in the switch is a word on a screen, so the studio
 *    should be able to change it without a deploy. It is stored as a copy row
 *    and lifted back out into `site` by worker/domain/bundle.ts.
 *
 * The nav used to be the third divergence and is not one any more: it is a
 * projection of the pages now, built by the template from `navLabel`, so
 * nothing here or there holds a second list that could disagree with the first.
 *
 * The copy cannot drift dangerously in either direction: the template re-parses
 * every field at build time, so a mismatch fails the build and never reaches
 * the live site.
