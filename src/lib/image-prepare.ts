/**
 * Photographs are resized before they are ever uploaded — and measured on the
 * way past, because this is the only place the pixels are ever open.
 *
 * The site asks Cloudflare for derivatives no wider than 2400 pixels, so a
 * 6000-pixel original contributes nothing but storage and upload time.
 * Downscaling here — in the browser, before the bytes leave it — turns a 6 MB
 * phone photograph into something a few hundred kilobytes wide, and drops the
 * EXIF block (which routinely carries GPS coordinates) on the way through,
 * since canvas encoding keeps pixels and nothing else.
 *
 * The dimensions are deliberately not returned. The Worker measures them from
 * the bytes it receives, because they become the aspect box that holds the
 * page still while an image loads, and a number the site's CLS budget depends
 * on should come from the file rather than from whatever the client claimed.
 *
 * The hue is the exception, and it is one because of where the pixels are. A
 * Worker can read a JPEG's header and cannot decode its image — there is no
 * decoder in the runtime and no sharp — so the only process in the system that
 * has this photograph as colours rather than as bytes is this one, which has
 * just decoded it to resize it. So it measures the hue in the same pass. The
 * Worker still refuses anything that is not an angle, and the column refuses it
 * again; what it cannot do is find the number itself.
