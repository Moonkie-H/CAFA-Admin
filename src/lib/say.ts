/**
 * A phrase from the validator, said in whichever language the studio is reading.
 *
 * `shared/content/validate` runs in the Worker as well as in the browser, so it can
 * only ever produce a key and the numbers to fill it with — see the `Phrase`
 * type there. This is the other half: the hook that turns one into words.
 *
 * It resolves depth-first, because a phrase's values may be phrases. "Cover
 * (Chinese)" is `problems.label.inLocale` filled with `fields.cover` and
 * `problems.locale.zh`, and each of those has to be said before the sentence
 * around it can be — which is also why they nest rather than concatenate: the
 * pieces do not join in the same order in both languages.
