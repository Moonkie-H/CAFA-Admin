/**
 * What has to be fixed before this can be saved.
 *
 * Capped at a dozen with a count for the rest: a fresh import with every alt
 * text missing produces hundreds, and a list that long stops being a list of
 * things to do and becomes a wall to scroll past.
 *
 * The validator hands over phrases rather than sentences — a key and the
 * numbers to fill it with — because it also runs in the Worker, which has no
 * translator and no idea what language anyone is reading. This is where they
 * become words, which is why this is the only file that knows the banner is
 * bilingual at all.
